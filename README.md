This web application is used for analyzing and comparing popular YouTube video trends and comments, enabling users to gain insights into topics that can garner high views or optimal upload times. It utilizes the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch rankings of popular videos from various countries and provides features such as upload patterns and sentiment analysis of video comments.

The application is developed primarily in Python and relies on the Pandas library for data processing and analysis. Sentiment analysis of YouTube comments is performed using a pretrained model (`matthewburke/korean_sentiment`). Additionally, the OpenAI API is utilized for interpreting complex data analysis results and providing meaningful insights. Streamlit library is used to provide an intuitive and user-friendly web interface.

> (Beta Version) Added feature to determine if specific videos are suitable for children by checking the frequency of profanity in the comments.

## Introduction
**YouTube Trend Dashboard** provides an easy way to grasp the latest YouTube trends and helps users find optimal upload times and topics to garner more views. Users can increase their chances of success on YouTube by planning content aligned with trends and uploading strategies. Choosing the right topic and upload timing are crucial factors for success on YouTube. This dashboard provides practical data and analysis to optimize these aspects.

## Design Pattern
- **Model:**
  - In `model.py`, data is fetched from the YouTube Data API to provide video data to the rest of the application. It also handles data processing and analysis, including additional logic such as sentiment analysis (`sentiment_analysis.py`).
- **View:**
  - `view.py` is responsible for constructing the user interface using Streamlit, fetching data from the model based on user input, and visualizing the data received.
- **Controller:**
  - `controller.py` requests data from the model based on user input, processes the data, and passes it to the view. It centralizes logic for handling user input.

## Brief Feature Overview
- **Country Selection:** Users can select a country to view popular YouTube videos from that region.
- **Popular Video Analysis:** Displays a dashboard of popular videos with sorting and paging functionalities.
- **Analysis Features:** Options for analyzing upload ratios by day or time, average tag count in popular videos, etc.
- **Word Cloud Visualization:** Generates a word cloud of popular video titles to provide visual insights into common topics or keywords.
- **YouTube Comment Analysis:** Analyzes sentiments (positive/negative) of comments on specific videos.
- **Interactive Interface:** Provides a conversational interface using Streamlit for easy exploration of various analyses and visualizations.
- **YouTube Comparison:** Compares information between two YouTube videos.
